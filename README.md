### User Story

Mathematical vectors are a precise way to describe directions in space as a vector is an object with magnitude and directions which can be expressed as cordinates. As shown below

As seen we can represent every point on the grid as an ordered pair in the form (a, b) in relation to the origin mid point that is  (0,0). Vectors can be added together (vector addition), subtracted (vector subtraction) and multiplied by scalars (scalar multiplication). Vector multiplication is not uniquely defined, but a number of different types of products, such as the dot product, cross product, and tensor direct product can be defined for pairs of vectors. Some of these functions can be found in the index.js file.
